    - # untracked [orange]
    - # stashes [red]

    - always show totals, regardless of whether aggregate or singular
    - if unchanged or stashes, bg=red
    - if untracked, bg=orange
    - if outgoing or garbage, bg=yellow
    - if still linked to an open trelo card, jira issue, github issue, color=cyan
    - show # of OK projects/workspaces
- put something in PS1 or RPROMPT maybe
  - summary of current project (or workspace if aggregate)
    - # changed [red]
    - # untracked [orange]
    - # stashes [red]

- is the current dir a virtualenv that you need to source?
- is there something that we like to have running in the background while we're working in this dir?
- ability to link a workspace and/or project to a ...
  - trello card
  - jira ticket
  - github project issue
- use https://pypi.python.org/pypi/python-daemon/ to spin up a service daemon in the
  background which can respond to requests more quickly
